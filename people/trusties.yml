  bio: |
    Venu (GVGK Raju) and Chitra have always been interested in alternatives to mainstream 
    education and living, and plunged into it in 2009, when their child was diagnosed with autism.
    <br><br>
    Initially, Venu worked with an edtech startup and chitra acquired ABA training and certifications,
    so as to work with their child better. Sambhavam was formally started in 2016, as an early intervention
    center working with families living with autism. 
    <br><br>
    As their child and other children around them grew up, they saw that the many schools around them
    not being able to meet the needs of children - neurodiverse or otherwise. This, and exposure to some
    of the alternative schools they admire, led them to dream of a neurodiverse, close to nature, learning
    community. 
    <br><br>
    That dream started to realise when they were able to open Farm Hill Learning in 2019. After five years 
    of Farm Hill, and witnessing the benefits of a community for both parents and children, in 2024, they took
    the step of opening Subodha Learning Community, a homeschool support center, in Banglore 
    <br><br>
    They divide their time between Bangalore and Farm Hill Learning, Shoolagiri, where they live on a 
    mango farm in a community of teachers, therapists, adults and children.
