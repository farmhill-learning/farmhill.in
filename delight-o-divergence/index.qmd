The teams at Sambhavam and Farm Hill conducted the first autism awareness event in 2016. Last year, for the first time, we braded the event as Delights of Divergence. We set up stalls in two different locations on two different days. 

Our aim is to meet people that would otherwise not come in direct touch with autism. Our stalls are set up on the side of the road, and we engage all passers by! We want to raise awareness of autism, while also raising funds through sale of art, craft and food items produced by our neurodiverse community! 

Come join us, learn more about autism and partake in the delights of divergence!!
